## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In this section of the project, knowledge of R was used for designing a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using various variables from the MechaCar dataset. Linear regression is considered to be a statistical model used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on various independent variables fitted to the equation of line. As it can be seen in the figure below, our resulting model is as follow:

**mpg = 6.267(vehicle_length) + 0.001245(vehicle_weight) + 0.06877(spoiler_angle) + 3.546(ground_clearance) - 3.411(AWD) - 104**

Looking at the multiple linear regression results as shown in the figure below, the following can be addressed:

- The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the linear model are vehicle_length and ground_clearance as well as intercept due to their low p-values. As a result of this, these variables are found to have significant impact on the mpg and less random variance to the linear model.

- The p-value of our linear regression analysis is **5.35e-11** which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of **0.05%**. Therefore, we can state that there is a sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, and this means the slope of our linear model is not zero.

- The linear model can effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes since the r-squared value is **0.7149** which means that approximately 71% of mpg predictions will be correct using this linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

In this portion of the project, knowledge of R was used for creating a summary statistics showing the suspension coil's PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots as well as the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI column for each lot using the suspension coil dataset that contained the results from multiple production lots. Furthermore, the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not overcome 100 pounds per square inch. Thus, as it can be seen in the figure below the current manufacturing data for all manufacturing lots meet this design specification since the variance is **62.294 PSI** which is well within the 100 PSI variance requirement.

Additionally, looking at the variances of each lot individually as demonstrated in the figure below, it can be clearly seen that lot 1 and lot 2 are both within the design specification with variances of **0.98** and **7.47** respectively. However, lot 3 is exceeding the manufacturing specification due to its high variance of **170.29**.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

In this portion of the project, t-Tests were performed for determining if all the manufacturing lots and each individual lot were statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. Looking at the t-Test carried out for all of the manufacturing lots as illustrated in the figure below, it can be seen that there is no enough evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis since the p-value is **0.06028** which is greater than the assumed significance level of **0.05%**. Thus, the PSI across all manufacturing lots are not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Furthermore, looking at the t-Test results performed for each individual lot as shown in the figures below, the following can be seen:

- Lot 1 has a p-value of 1 which is greater than the common significance level of 0.05%, hence there is no enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. As a result of this the sample mean and the presumed population mean of 1500 are not statistically different.

- Similar to lot 1, lot 2 has a p-value of **0.6072** which is greater than the significance level of 0.05% which means there is no enough evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis. Thus, the population mean and the sample mean are statistically similar.

- Looking at the t-test performed for lot 3, it can be seen that its p-value of **0.04168** is lower than the significance level of 0.05%, hence, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that this sample mean is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

In this section of the report, we will be designing a statistical study for comparing the performance of the MechaCar against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers. In order to compare the performance of the MechaCar against their competitors we need to consider the metric that would be of interest to the customers. As a result, one of the most critical metric that would be of interest to consumers is highway fuel efficiency of a vehicle. Thus, comparing the highway fuel efficiency of MechaCar prototypes with those of their competitors would be considered as a statistical study that should be performed. 
We are required to test whether the highway fuel efficiency of the MechaCar is statistically different from their competitors or not. 

Thus, the null and alternative hypotheses can be stated as the following:

 - Null hypothesis (HO): There is no statistical difference between the prototype sample mean and the market mean.
 - Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a statistical difference between the prototype sample mean and the market mean.

 As a result of this, a statistical test has to be considered for testing our hypothesis. Thus, one sample t-Test is chosen as a statistical test to be performed for comparing the population of different competitor vehicle types after collecting the required data from various types of competitor vehicles that are present in the market.
 Furthermore, the data needed for running the statistical test can be gathered from the top 10 samples of MechaCar prototypes that are expected to have varying specifications from ground clearance and lengths of vehicle since these variables were found to have greatest impact on the mpg. Thus, these specifications could be compared to those of the competitor cars for identifying which vehicle would be having better fuel efficiency. Additionally, the p-value has to be evaluated against the common significance factor of 0.05% and if itâ€™s found to be smaller than this factor, then there will be enough evidence that the null hypothesis can be rejected and alternative hypothesis would be stated as true.
